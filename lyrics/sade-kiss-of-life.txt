<h4>[Verse 1]</h4>
<p class="verse">
  There must have been an angel by my side<br />
  Something heavenly led me to you<br />
  Look at the sky<br />
  It's the colour of love<br />
  There must have been an angel by my side<br />
  Something heavenly came down from above<br />
  He led me to you<br />
  He led me to you
</p>

  He built a bridge to your heart<br />
  All the way<br />
  How many tonnes of love inside?<br />
  I can't say

<h4>[Verse 2]</h4>
<p class="verse">
  When I was led to you<br />
  I knew you were the one for me<br />
  I swear the whole world could feel my heartbeat<br />
  When I lay eyes on you<br />
  I-I-I-I-I<br />
  You wrap me up in<br />
  The colour of love
</p>

<h4>[Chorus]</h4>

  You gave me the kiss of life<br />
  Kiss of life<br />
  You gave me the kiss that's like<br />
  Kiss of life
