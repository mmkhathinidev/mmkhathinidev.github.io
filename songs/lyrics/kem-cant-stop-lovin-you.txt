<h4>[Verse 1]</h4>
<p class="verse">
I think about the day I met<br/>
The perfect stranger<br/>
I think about us<br/>
And I think about the day I got wrapped<br/>
Around your finger<br/>
I think about us
</p>

<h4>[Pre-Chorus]</h4>
<p class="pre-chorus">
The sun was shinin' on you<br/>
The Lord was smilin' on me<br/>
And love was callin' us<br/>
I had my mind made up
</p>

<h4>[Chorus]</h4>
<p class="chorus">
That I can't stop lovin' you<br/>
I can't help myself<br/>
And I can't get over you<br/>
No matter what I tell myself, baby
</p>

<h4>[Verse 2]</h4>
<p class="verse">
Never thought I'd ever love any one else<br/>
In my weakness<br/>
I think about us<br/>
And I think about the day you left<br/>
Without speakin'<br/>
I think about us<br/>
I think about the love we had<br/>
For our children<br/>
I think about us<br/>
I think about the way we laughed<br/>
Without a reason<br/>
I think about us, girl, ooh, yay
</p>

<h4>[Pre-Chorus]</h4>
<p class="pre-chorus">
There will be no more lies<br/>
Somebody tell me why I feel like I'm dyin'<br/>
Lord what's come over me<br/>
Ooh, baby, can't you see
</p>

<h4>[Chorus]</h4>
<p class="chorus">
That I can't stop lovin' you (I can't stop lovin' you, girl)<br/>
I can't help myself, ooh, babe<br/>
And I can't get over you (I can't get over you, baby)<br/>
No matter what I tell myself, baby, yeah (No matter what, no matter what I tell myself, babe)<br/>
I can't stop lovin' you (I can't, stop lovin' you, girl, stop lovin' you, girl)<br/>
No matter how hard I try, yeah (No matter how hard I try)<br/>
And I can't get over you, babe (And I can't, get over you, babe)<br/>
And I don't know why
</p>

<h4>[Interlude]</h4>
<p class="interlude">
I think about us<br/>
I think about us<br/>
I think about us<br/>
And think about us<br/>
Think about us<br/>
I think about us<br/>
I think about us
</p>

<h4>[Outro]</h4>
<p class="outro">
Mmm, babe<br/>
I can't get over you<br/>
Mmm, yeah, babe<br/>
Mmm, girl<br/>
What am I gonna do?<br/>
Mmm, babe<br/>
I think about, the love we had<br/>
I think about, the way you laugh<br/>
Mmm, girl, hey<br/>
I can't get over you<br/>
I can't stop kissin' you, babe<br/>
I can't stop wantin' you, babe<br/>
I can't stop lovin' you, girl<br/>
Yeah, ay-ay-ay<br/>
Can't get over you<br/>
I can't stop missin' you, girl<br/>
I can't stop feelin' you, girl<br/>
I can't stop thinkin' 'bout ya<br/>
I can't stop dreamin' 'bout ya<br/>
I can't stop lovin' you, girl
