<h4>[Verse 1]</h4>
<p class="verse">
  Always and forever<br/>
  Each moment with you, yeah<br/>
  Is just like a dream to me<br/>
  That somehow came true, yeah<br/>
  And I know tomorrow<br/>
  Will still be the same<br/>
  'Cause we got a life of love<br/>
  That won't ever change and
</p>

<h4>[Chorus]</h4>
<p class="chorus">
  Every day, love me your own special way<br/>
  Melt all my heart away with a smile<br/>
  Take time to tell me you really care<br/>
  And we'll share tomorrow together<br/>
  (Always forever love you)<br/>
  Ooh, baby, I'll always love you forever<br/>
  (Always forever love you)<br/>
  Ever, ever, ever
